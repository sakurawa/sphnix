# Chapter Ⅰ. What Is Technical Communication?
## What Is Technical Communication?

Technical communication encompasses a set of activities that people do to discover, shape, and transmit information. 

When you produce technical communication you use the four basic communication skills—listening, speaking, reading, and writing—to analyze a problem, find and evaluate evidence, and draw conclusions. 

The biggest difference between technical communication and the other kinds of writing you have done is that technical communication has a somewhat different focus on audience and purpose.
## The Challenges of Producing Technical Communication

No matter what document you produce or contribute to, you need to begin by considering three sets of factors: 

1. Audience-related factors.
2. Purpose-related factors.
3. Document-related factors.
   
Because all these factors interact in complicated ways, every technical document you create involves a compromise.
## Characteristics of a Technical Document
Almost every technical document that gets the job done has six major characteristics: 

1. It addresses particular readers. 
2. It helps readers solve problems.
3. It reflects the organization’s goals and culture.
